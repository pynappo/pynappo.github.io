## Use :Inspect for checking highlights

`:Inspect` will check highlights at the cursor postion. This can help you figure out what text is affected by.

## Inspecting lua state

You can run lua from the command line:

```
:lua vim.notify('hi!')
```

You can inspect any global/`require`able variables from the command line

```
:=require('lazy')
```

This is shorthand for:

```
:lua vim.print(require('lazy'))
```

`vim.print(...)` is a wrapper around `print(vim.inspect(...))` which also returns the arguments that are
passed in. If you get an error and properly follow the stacktrace, you can wrap anything you want to inspect with it:

```lua
local foo = bar:gsub("asdf", "hjkl")
--          ^^^^^^^^ let's say you get an error here:
-- foo is unaffected no matter what you wrap with vim.print:
local foo = vim.print(bar):gsub("asdf", "hjkl")
-- 
```


## Get familiar with stdpath()s

Neovim has documented "standard paths" that are used by Neovim and plugins to store things in consistent locations,
defaulting to sensible locations on Unix/Windows. Largely speaking, lazy.nvim installs plugins
under the data directory, so for lazy.nvim users, if you get a stacktrace where you see an error for a plugin, but can't see the full
directory name, you likely want to start under the result of:

```
:echo stdpath('data')
```
