# KeePass is great!

Currently, I use a KeePass database synced across all my devices using Syncthing. For clients, I use KeePassXC and
KeePassDX on their respective platforms. The database is detected by one very long password. For me this accomplishes a
few things:

- Full control of database and how/where it's backed up
- Cross platform support
- Full access offline
- Using more FOSS software (although not a big deal to me)
- Secret service support through KeePassXC (convenient so I don't have to install a seperate program for Linux)

Overall besides how their browser extension isn't very good, this is a pretty satisfying setup for me.

# Passwords

Generally speaking, for accounds that have important data I always generate a random secure password through KeePass.
If it's not that important, I honestly just use the same few kinds of passwords everywhere so I don't have to back it up
into KeePass immediately or pull up KeePass.

# 2FA and Passkeys

Whereever possible, I use YubiKey, KeePassXC, and/or my phone as either passkeys or 2FA. Using these mostly physical
passkeys should prevent my accounts from being logged into from other parts of the world.

I also use Aegis to store TOTP on my phone. I prefer to keep the TOTP secrets in Aegis instead of KeePass because I like
the UX of Aegis more (easier to copy, easy to open through the quick settings button, etc.).
